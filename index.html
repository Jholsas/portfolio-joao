            <p class="experiencia__descricao-destaque">Project highlight: Digital Transformation of the HR sector.</p>
            </br>
            <p><b>Premise:</b> The HR sector of a large company faced difficulties in carrying out routine processes
              such as requesting vacations, reimbursement in case of business trips, leave due to illness or pregnancy,
              layoffs and hiring. Because each of these processes generates a large volume of emails. In addition, much
              of this information was controlled by spreadsheets, which generated a high risk of data loss and human
              errors.
              The client required the automation of these processes, the centralization of information and the creation
              of digital tools to improve communication and collaboration between teams. In addition to integrating this
              new application via API to the company's ERP.</p>
            <p><b>Development:</b> The project was completed - to meet all the requested items were developed an
              application with five modules, which can be used both on computers and smartphones - In this way,
              centralized the information, making the process much faster and more efficient.</p>

              cleanly
              and functionally.</p>
            <p><b>Learnings:</b> Communication was fundamental to understanding the HR routines requirements, because it
              is not only complex, but also has a legal basis, which is why an HR specialist was needed on the team -
              OutSystems technology is a complex low code tool and was something It was new to me at the time, but I was
              able to learn how to use it and it was possible to develop user-friendly and responsive applications.</p>
